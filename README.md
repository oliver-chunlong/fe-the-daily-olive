# 📰 The Daily Olive: A Northcoders Frontend Project

The Daily Olive is a mock news site for articles, comments, votes, and all the juicy internet opinions you want to sink your teeth into.

Originally developed for the Northcoders Software Development Bootcamp frontend project, it showcases the fundamentals of full-stack architecture from a frontend perspective. The app delivers a responsive and interactive user experience entirely in the browser, communicating seamlessly with a RESTful API.

This is not the final form of The Daily Olive. New features and improvements will be layered in as the project evolves.
